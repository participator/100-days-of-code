# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 38, Monday, March 26, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Work on project, refactoring filter using default parameters and both array and object destructing to ease development of variable length of parameters.

**Thoughts**: Implementing more ES6 features in the browser :0, i.e. boycotting IE :).

### Day 37, Saturday, March 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Peer Programming, reviewing service worker course on Udacity.

**Thoughts**: This makes much more sense the second time around.  Almost ready to start implementing it.

### Day 36, Wednesday, March 22, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Implementing a more flexible filter that searches by various fields and text.

**Thoughts**: I'm planning to catch most used cases, so this involves a lot of planning.
Also, this is my first day trying to set a schedule to wake up early and code :).

### Day 35, Monday, March 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Work on project adding flex to align two columns of text in the center of the page.  Find and add several resources. Rediscovered a good resource that I previously underrated #DontJudgeASiteByItsStyles.

**Thoughts**: Making good progress. Having good team chemistry is turning into a good product.

### Day 34, Friday, March 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Work on project implementing filter to use on predefined filters and search box.

**Thoughts**: This filter approach uses behavior delegation as shown in the YDKJS series.  I read this JS resource over a year ago and still like using for reference.

### Day 33, Wednesday, March 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Work on project making all JS available under single namespace. Read about design tips for text.
Start reading the Observer Pattern from Head First Design Patterns and create example in C#.

**Thoughts**: Someone wrote these design tips and patterns with me in mind and answered some things I question and (re)invent along the way.

### Day 32, Tuesday, March 6, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continuing Udacity, Grow With Google, Mobile Web Specialist Track:
Continue IndexDB and reading Head First Design Patterns.

### Day 31, Saturday, March 4, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continuing Udacity, Grow With Google, Mobile Web Specialist Track:
Completed Polyfill and Transpiling course. Staring working with IndexDB and reading Head First Design Patterns.
Troubleshooting node server not stopping when pressing Ctrl+C.

**Thoughts**: I am more of a VanillaJS dev and an advocate for the deprecation of IE11.  I have to start using transpiling more ofter so that I can worry less about browser capability.

### Day 30, Saturday, February 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learn more about Promises. Hacked around with CSS before & after.

**Thoughts**: I don't currently use promises much (still using callbacks do to IE compatibility restrictions), so I appreciate improving my knowledge on these.  Learning about more usages for before and after is incredible.  I had no idea that I haven't used them to their full potential.

### Day 29, Saturday, January 27, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Check service worker state and display message to user when new service worker is installed.

### Day 23, Saturday, January 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learning about Service Workers

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to learned about making web sites functional offline and I'm sold on it being the future of applications (web and possibly replacing native).

### Day 22, Friday, January 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Testing React App with Jest

**Thoughts**: My first thought is that snapshot testing with Jest is pretty simple and straight forward. 

### Day 21, Friday, December 29, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Complete Random Quote Machine. Start local weather app.

**Thoughts**: All done, instead of retrieving values from cache the initial request is save in a JS variable and each quote is obtain from this object henceforth.

### Day 20, Tuesday, December 06, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Build a Random Quote Machine

**Thoughts**: First time coding for a straight hour for myself in awhile. I am focusing a lot on design, learning to force cache, getting quote from list retrieved from api, and using fetch.
**Next: Force retrieving quotes from cache, so they won't be refreshed ever time button is pressed. Animated quote with fly-in.

### Day 19: Saturday, November 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed completing these challenges. Although, many exercises seemed simple in concept, I see areas where my speed of creating the solution can improve.  That means I'll be coding even more.

### Day 18: Saturday, November 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continue Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts**: I am able to get to all of the problems so far without help.  I am getting better as I go along with solving them faster.  After solving the problem, it's nice to review others solutions to find ways to code less lines.

### Day 17: Saturday, November 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Complete Basic Javascript, Complete Object Oriented and Functional Programming, Start Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts**: Javascript section was long, but I'm now finished.  I learned how to create and use constructors in JS. I seen them used before, but haven't used them myself.

### Day 16: Wednesday, November 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continue: Basic Javascript


### Day 15: Wednesday, October 25, 2017,
**Today's Progress**: Continue: Basic Javascript

 **Thoughts**:** More reviewing, but today I truly understand what is means when it is said that strings (literals) are immutable in JS.  I learned with perfect example of assigning a string to a variable and attempting to change a character by indexing in it and updating the value.
 ex. var thing = "mop"; thing[0] = "b"; console.log(thing); // "mop"

### Day 13: Monday, October 23, 2017,
**Today's Progress**: Continue: Building a Personal Portfolio. Add placeholders for portfolio objects. Placeholders are responsive.  Add social media icons.

**Thoughts**:** For my first personal fully created site, it's looking nice.  Bootstrap does make creating responsive sites easier.  Next I'll finish by adding links to social media icons.

### Day 12: Thursday, October 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue: Building a Personal Portfolio. Color logo. Add Bootrap classes to navigation. Research when to used button over anchor tags for on page navigation links.

**Thoughts**:** Structuring the page using html5 tags. My logo is pretty nice.  The contact may be difficult to get right, so I may add quick text to keep moving.

### Day 11: Wednesday, October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue: Building a Personal Portfolio

**Thoughts**:** Today I completed the logo.  I could not get the arcTo function to draw what I wanted, so I switched to the quadraticCurveTo and was easily able to get the curve I wanted.

### Day 10: Tuesday, October 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start Building a Personal Portfolio

**Thoughts**:** I went off on a tangent (sort of) and create a custom logo using canvas.  This was my first time playing with it.  The straight lines were easy to create, but the hardest thing for me was creating a curve.  I found that positioning was basically done by trail and error, however, I would love to find a better way.

### Day 9: Monday, October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed modified code from node app.  Add response as html and json.

**Thoughts**:** I will learn how to pass a value from the server to the client.  The client will than increment that value and send it back to the server.
For this, I ran into socket.io that should help achieve this.  However, I wonder how I can do this natively with node.  socket.io has a create a chat app tutorial
that I will do tomorrow.

### Day 8: Sunday, October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Develop a node application that logs request details to a file.

**Thoughts**:** Node is cool because it uses Javascript.  Only used node for it's package manager in the past.  Using as a server is cool and helps me understand the parts of the web better.  

**Resources:** [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/)
