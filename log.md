# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: October 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Environment Setup: Install/update of node, npm, react, and react dom.

**Thoughts:** More comfortable with setting up git repos, npm repos, and installing npm packages

### Day 1: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Environment Setup: Install git with .gitignore file, Create local Directory for 100DaysofCode, Create SSH key to connect to GitHub, Pull & Push Update to Repo

**Thoughts:** This uses up time quickly.  I planned on setting up my environment to code for React, but did not get to it yet.
