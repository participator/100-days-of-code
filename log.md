# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: Saturday, November 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continue Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts: I am able to get to all of the problems so far without help.  I am getting better as I go along with solving them faster.  After solving the problem, it's nice to review others solutions to find ways to code less lines.

### Day 16: Wednesday, November 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continue: Basic Javascript


### Day 15: Wednesday, October 25, 2017,
**Today's Progress**: Continue: Basic Javascript

 **Thoughts:** More reviewing, but today I truly understand what is means when it is said that strings (literals) are immutable in JS.  I learned with perfect example of assigning a string to a variable and attempting to change a character by indexing in it and updating the value.
 ex. var thing = "mop"; thing[0] = "b"; console.log(thing); // "mop"

### Day 13: Monday, October 23, 2017,
**Today's Progress**: Continue: Building a Personal Portfolio. Add placeholders for portfolio objects. Placeholders are responsive.  Add social media icons.

**Thoughts:** For my first personal fully created site, it's looking nice.  Bootstrap does make creating responsive sites easier.  Next I'll finish by adding links to social media icons.

### Day 12: Thursday, October 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue: Building a Personal Portfolio. Color logo. Add Bootrap classes to navigation. Research when to used button over anchor tags for on page navigation links.

**Thoughts:** Structuring the page using html5 tags. My logo is pretty nice.  The contact may be difficult to get right, so I may add quick text to keep moving.

### Day 11: Wednesday, October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue: Building a Personal Portfolio

**Thoughts:** Today I completed the logo.  I could not get the arcTo function to draw what I wanted, so I switched to the quadraticCurveTo and was easily able to get the curve I wanted.

### Day 10: Tuesday, October 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start Building a Personal Portfolio

**Thoughts:** I went off on a tangent (sort of) and create a custom logo using canvas.  This was my first time playing with it.  The straight lines were easy to create, but the hardest thing for me was creating a curve.  I found that positioning was basically done by trail and error, however, I would love to find a better way.

### Day 9: Monday, October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed modified code from node app.  Add response as html and json.

**Thoughts:** I will learn how to pass a value from the server to the client.  The client will than increment that value and send it back to the server.
For this, I ran into socket.io that should help achieve this.  However, I wonder how I can do this natively with node.  socket.io has a create a chat app tutorial
that I will do tomorrow.

### Day 8: Sunday, October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Develop a node application that logs request details to a file.

**Thoughts:** Node is cool because it uses Javascript.  Only used node for it's package manager in the past.  Using as a server is cool and helps me understand the parts of the web better.  

**Resources:** [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/)
