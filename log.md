# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 5: October 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC FrontEnd Development Certification: Started jQuery section.  I also linked my github account today.

**Thoughts:** I skipped learning jQuery in favor of VanillaJS, so I'm learning.  Goodstuff. I find it interesting that jQuery is taught before VanillaJS.

### Day 3: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp FrontEnd Development Certification.

**Thoughts:** So far it's a review for me. I can't wait to get to the projects.  I value the basics, so I will diligently and quickly follow the ciriculum.  Never know what might be made more clear for me by doing so.

### Day 1: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Environment Setup: Install git with .gitignore file, Create local Directory for 100DaysofCode, Create SSH key to connect to GitHub, Pull & Push Update to Repo

**Thoughts:** This uses up time quickly.  I planned on setting up my environment to code for React, but did not get to it yet.
